# DNA-visualization-using-GANs

---

## Description

This is a project for 2020 bioinformatics-hackathon, which aims to create a new method to visualize our genomes and makes it looks cool! 
In the project, I used the generative-adversarial-networks to generate DNA pictures 


## Results

## Datasets

Testing datasets are from [impute.me](impute.me) website

## Methods

**`hardware`**
+ CUDA GPU

**`programming language`**
+ R

**`model`**
